## Summary: Thinking in bets - Annie Duke

### Chapter 1: life is poker, not chess

“Over time, those world-class poker players taught me to understand what a bet really is: a decision about an uncertain future. The implications of treating decisions as bets made it possible for me to find learning opportunities in uncertain environments.”

“The approach of thinking in bets moved me toward objectivity, accuracy, and open-mindedness. That movement compounds over time to create significant changes in our lives.”

**Pete Carroll was a victim of our tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome: resulting**

“We are uncomfortable with the idea that luck plays a significant role in our lives. We recognize the existence of luck, but we resist the idea that, despite our best efforts, things might not work out the way we want.”

**Incorrectly interpreting rustling from the wind as an oncoming lion is called a type I error, a false positive. The consequences of such an error were much less grave than those of a type II error, a false negative. A false negative could have been fatal: hearing rustling and always assuming it’s the wind would have gotten our ancestors eaten, and we wouldn’t be here.**

Survival and advancement

“The etiquette and rules of the game discourage players from slowing down the game to deliberate”

If play er is slow, ‘call the clock’, gives other player 70 seconds to make up their mind. 

“Poker players, as a result, must become adept at in-the-moment decision-making or they won’t survive in the profession”

“Poker players have the same struggle, with the added challenges of time pressure, in-your-face uncertainty, and immediate financial consequences. ”

Game theory: “the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers.”

“Game theory is the modern basis for the study of the bulk of our decision-making, addressing the challenges of changing conditions, hidden information, chance, and multiple people involved in the decisions.”

Real games: “Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do.” “They involve uncertainty, risk, and occasional deception, prominent elements in poker.”

“If we buy a house, fix it up a little, and sell it three years later for 50% more than we paid, does that mean we are smart at buying and selling property, or at fixing up houses? It could, but it could also mean there was a big upward trend in the market and buying almost any piece of property would have made just as much money. Or maybe buying that same house and not fixing it up at all might have resulted in the same (or even better) profit”

What good poker players and good decision-makers have in common is their comfort with the world being an uncertain and unpredictable place: 

1. They understand that they can almost never know exactly how something will turn out. 
2. They embrace that uncertainty and, instead of focusing on being sure, they try to figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur. The accuracy of those guesses will depend on how much information they have and how experienced they are at making such guesses. This is part of the basis of all bets.

“There are many reasons why wrapping our arms around uncertainty and giving it a big hug will help us become better decision-makers. Here are two of them. First, “I’m not sure” is simply a more accurate representation of the world. Second, and related, when we accept that we can’t be sure, we are less likely to fall into the trap of black-and-white thinking.”

“make an allocation of resources (a bet) on the calculation”

“every decision has risks, regardless of whether we acknowledge them. Even a set salary is still not “guaranteed.”

“Although employers aren’t trying to entice employees to quit, their goal is similar in arriving at a compensation package to get the prospect to accept the offer and stay in the job. They must balance offering attractive pay and benefits with going too far and impairing their ability to make a profit. Employers also want employees to be loyal, and work long, productive hours, and maintain morale. An employer might or might not offer on-premises child care. That could encourage someone to work more hours . . . or scare off a prospective employee because it implies they may be expected to sacrifice aspects of their non-work lives.”

By treating decisions as bets, poker players explicitly recognize that they are deciding on alternative futures, each with benefits and risks. They also recognize there are no simple answers. Some things are unknown or unknowable. 

**The promise of this book is that if we follow the example of poker players by making explicit that our decisions are bets, we can make better decisions and anticipate (and take protective measures) when irrationality is likely to keep us from acting in our best interest.**

### Chapter 2: wanna bet?

“Investments are clearly bets”

“Whenever we make a parenting choice (about discipline, nutrition, school, parenting philosophy, where to live, etc.), we are betting that our choice will achieve the future we want for our children more than any other choice we might make given the constraints of the limited resources we have to allocate—our time, our money, our attention.”

“belief calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update our beliefs to more accurately represent the world”

belief formation 

“People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to believe and very difficult to doubt. In fact, believing is so easy, and perhaps so inevitable, that it may be more like involuntary comprehension than it is like rational assessment.”

“Subjects under time pressure or who had their cognitive load increased by a minor distraction made more errors in recalling whether the statements were true or false. But the errors weren’t random. The subjects were not equally likely to ignore some statements labeled “true” as they were to rely on some statements labeled “false.” Rather, their errors went in one direction: under any sort of pressure, they presumed all the statements were true, regardless of their labeling. This suggests our default setting is to believe what we hear is true.”

If you're - absolutely - sure about something and a friend challenges you to a bet:

**Wanna bet?**

- How do I know this?
- Where did I get this information?
- Who did I get it from?
- What is the quality of my sources?
- How much do I trust them?
- How up to date is my information?
- How much information do I have that is relevant to the belief?
- What other things like this have I been confident about that turned out not to be true?
- What are the other plausible alternatives?
- What do I know about the person challenging my belief?
- What is their view of how credible my opinion is?
- What do they know that I don’t know?
- What is their level of expertise?
- What am I missing?

“What if, in addition to expressing what we believe, we also rated our level of confidence about the accuracy of our belief on a scale of zero to ten?”

“So instead of saying to ourselves, “Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture,” we would say, “I think Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture but I’m only a six on that.” Or “I’m 60% that Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture.”

“By expressing our level of confidence in what we believe, we are shifting our approach to how we view the world. Acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it. Incorporating uncertainty in the way we think about what we believe creates open-mindedness, moving us closer to a more objective stance toward information that disagrees with us.”

“Declaring our uncertainty in our beliefs to others makes us more credible communicators. We assume that if we don’t come off as 100% confident, others will value our opinions less. The opposite is usually true. If one person expresses a belief as absolutely true, and someone else expresses a belief by saying, “I believe this to be true, and I’m 80% on it,” who are you more likely to believe?”

“Acknowledging that decisions are bets based on our beliefs, getting comfortable with uncertainty, and redefining right and wrong are integral to a good overall approach to decision-making.”

### Chapter 3: bet to learn: fielding the unfolding future

**Learning occurs when you get lots of feedback tied closely in time to decisions and actions**

**The way our lives turn out is the result of two things: the influence of skill and the influence of luck.**

“An outcome like losing weight could be the direct result of a change in diet or increased exercise (skill), or a sudden change in our metabolism or a famine (luck). We could get in a car crash because we didn’t stop at a red light (skill) or because another driver ran a red light (luck). A student could do poorly on a test because they didn’t study (skill) or because the teacher is mean (luck).”

**We make similar bets about where to “throw” an outcome: into the “skill bucket” (in our control) or the “luck bucket” (outside of our control).** This initial fielding of outcomes, if done well, allows us to focus on experiences that have something to teach us (skill) and ignore those that don’t (luck). Get this right and, with experience, we get closer to whatever “-ER” we are striving for: better, smarter, healthier, happier, wealthier, etc.

**Self-serving bias” is the term for this pattern of fielding outcomes:**
The way we field outcomes is predictably patterned: we take credit for the good stuff and blame the bad stuff on luck so it won’t be our fault. The result is that we don’t learn from experience well.

“Whether it is a poker hand, an auto accident, a football call, a trial outcome, or a business success, there are elements of luck and skill in virtually any outcome.”

“Watching is an established learning method.”

“When any of us makes decisions in life away from the poker table, we always have something at risk: money, time, health, happiness, etc. ”

“We all want to feel good about ourselves in the moment, even if it’s at the expense of our long-term goals.”

“ That’s schadenfreude: deriving pleasure from someone else’s misfortune. Schadenfreude is basically the opposite of compassion.”

“If I field my win as having to do with my skillful play, then my opponent in the hand must have lost because of their less skillful play. Likewise, if I field my loss as having to do with luck, then my opponent must have won due to luck as well. Any other interpretation would create cognitive dissonance. 

Thinking about it this way, we see that the way we field other people’s outcomes is just part of self-serving bias. Viewed through this lens, the pattern begins to make sense.”

“It’s not enough to boost our self-image solely by our own successes. If someone we view as a peer is winning, we feel like we’re losing by comparison. We benchmark ourselves to them.”

What accounts for most of the variance in happiness is how we’re doing comparatively.
So happiness is not based on, as is what is common sense:
- comfortabel income, robus health, supportive marriage and lack of tragedy or trauma
- objective circumstances, demographic variables or life events

Reshaping habit

Phil Ivey: Wins a game. Then, at dinner, deconstructed every potential playing error and asking about each strategic decision. Normal player would be talking about how great their skills are.

“Charles Duhigg, in The Power of Habit, offers the golden rule of habit change, that the best way to deal with a habit is to respect the habit loop. 

To change a habit:
- you must keep the old cue, 
- and deliver the old reward, 
- but insert a new routine.”

Pavlov, dogs to be fed, dogs salivated when technician came in to provide food. They changed the cue/stimulus to a bell, and still dogs salivated. 

“We can work to change the bell we ring, substituting what makes us salivate. We can work to get the reward of feeling good about ourselves from being a good credit-giver, a good mistake-admitter, a good finder-of-mistakes-in-good-outcomes, a good learner, and (as a result) a good decision-maker.”

“Instead of feeling bad when we have to admit a mistake, what if the bad feeling came from the thought that we might be missing a learning opportunity just to avoid blame? Or that we might be basking in the credit of a good result instead of, like Phil Ivey, recognizing where we could have done better? If we work toward that, we can transform the unproductive habits of mind of self-serving bias and motivated reasoning into productive ones. If we put in the work to practice this routine, we can field more of our outcomes in an open-minded, more objective way, motivated by accuracy and truthseeking to drive learning. ”

**There are people who, like Phil Ivey, have substituted the routine of truthseeking for the outcome-oriented instinct to focus on seeking credit and avoiding blame. When we look at the people performing at the highest level of their chosen field, we find that the self-serving bias that interferes with learning often recedes and even disappears. The people with the most legitimate claim to a bulletproof self-narrative have developed habits around accurate self-critique.**

**“American soccer great Mia Hamm said, “Many people say I’m the best women’s soccer player in the world. I don’t think so. And because of that, someday I just might be.”**

Keep the reward of feeling like we are doing well compared to our peers, but change the features by which we compare ourselves: 

- be a better credit-giver than your peers, 
- more willing than others to admit mistakes, 
- more willing to explore possible reasons for an outcome with an open mind, 
- even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else. 

In this way we can feel that we are doing well by comparison because we are doing something unusual and hard that most people don’t do. That makes us feel exceptional.

“When I admitted mistakes, when I recognized the luck element in my successes, when I gave other players credit for making some good decisions, when I was eager to share a hand that I thought I played poorly because I might learn something from it, that chorus reminded me that what I was doing was hard, and that others weren’t often doing it.”

We might adopt the mindful practices of Buddhist monks, observing the flow of inner thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judging them as good or bad at all. But getting all the way there is a tall order if we don’t want to quit our day jobs and move to Tibet.

“We can get to this mindset shift by behaving as if we have something at risk when we sort outcomes into the luck and skill buckets”

“Thinking in bets also triggers perspective taking, leveraging the difference between how we field our own outcomes versus others’ outcomes to get closer to the objective truth.”

“striving for accuracy through probabilistic thinking is a worthwhile routine to pursue.”

“Just like declaring uncertainty in your beliefs, it eventually goes from a somewhat goofy and awkward extra step to a habit integral to how you view the world around you.”

### Chapter 4: the buddy system

David Letterman asked Lauren Conrad, of MTV serie The Hills about all the drama that was in her life, if she was maybe the source of it. Downplaying it with a story about him calling himself an idiot. She asked: so you say I'm an idiot? Letterman was trying to question her fielding skills, but, Conrad didn't sign up for this truthseeking on TV.

Neo chooses to see the world as it really is. “His comfortable world is a dream created by machines to enslave him as an energy source. His job and lifestyle, his clothes, his appearance, and the entire fabric of his life are an illusion implanted in his brain.”

“By choosing to exit the matrix, we are asserting that striving for a more objective representation of the world, even if it is uncomfortable at times, will make us happier and more successful in the long run.”

“I learned from this experience that thinking in bets was easier if I had other people to help me.”

“Remember the buddy system from school field trips or camp? Teachers or counselors would pair everybody up with a buddy. Our buddy was supposed to keep us from wandering off or getting into water too deep, and we did the same for our buddy. A good decision group is a grown-up version of the buddy system.”

**“Forming or joining a group where the focus is on thinking in bets means modifying the usual social contract. It means agreeing to be open-minded to those who disagree with us, giving credit where it’s due, and taking responsibility where it’s appropriate, even (and especially) when it makes us uncomfortable. That’s why, when we do it with others, we need to make it clear the social contract is being modified, or feelings will get hurt, defensiveness will rear its ugly head, and, just like Lauren Conrad, your audience won’t want to hear what you have to say.”**

Lerner & Tetlock described 2 kinds of group reasoning styles: “Whereas confirmatory thought involves a one-sided attempt to rationalize a particular point of view, exploratory thought involves even-handed consideration of alternative points of view.”

“Lerner and Tetlock offer insight into what should be included in the group agreement to avoid confirmatory thought and promote exploratory thought. “Complex and open-minded thought is most likely to be activated when decision makers learn prior to forming any opinions that they will be accountable to an audience 
- (a) whose views are unknown, 
- (b) who is interested in accuracy, 
- (c) who is reasonably well-informed, and 
- (d) who has a legitimate reason for inquiring into the reasons behind participants’ judgments/choices.”

“If you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth” 

“In combination, the advice of these experts in group interaction adds up to a pretty good blueprint for a truthseeking charter:
- A focus on accuracy (over confirmation), which includes rewarding truthseeking, objectivity, and open-mindedness within the group;
- Accountability, for which members have advance notice; and
- Openness to a diversity of ideas.”

“ We win bets by relentlessly striving to calibrate our beliefs and predictions about the future to more accurately represent the world.”

“The charter of the group must be communicated unambiguously.” “He told me the rules of being in a pod with him.”

Example in response to moaning about bad luck:
“I don’t want to hear it. I’m not trying to hurt your feelings, but if you have a question about a hand, you can ask me about strategy all day long. I just don’t think there’s much purpose in a poker story if the point is about something you had no control over, like bad luck”

“He discouraged me from confirmatory or biased thought like “I got unlucky.” He encouraged me to find things I might have control over and how to improve decisions about those.”

“Because I was lucky enough to be part of a group with a truthseeking charter, there was no question that my poker decision-making improved. When I could consult them on in-progress decisions, like whether to move up in stakes or bankroll management or game selection, their advice reduced the number of errors I was making. Likewise, access to their range of strategies and experiences improved the quality of my thinking and decisions on a continuing basis. When I had questions or didn’t understand why something happened, they would see things I didn’t. When they had questions or needed advice on a hand, I wasn’t just helping them work through a decision they made but would often get insights into my own game. Those interactions led to improvements in my game I would have overlooked or, at best, figured out on my own only after making a lot of costly errors.”

“Even better, interacting with similarly motivated people improves the ability to combat bias not just during direct interactions but when we are making and analyzing decisions on our own. The group gets into our head—in a good way—reshaping our decision habits.”

“I experienced firsthand the power of a group’s approval to reshape individual thinking habits. I got my fix by trying to be the best credit-giver, the best mistake-admitter, and the best finder-of-mistakes-in-good-outcomes.”

“Diversity and dissent are not only checks on fallibility, but the only means of testing the ultimate truth of an opinion: “The only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner.”

“When we think in bets, we run through a series of questions to examine the accuracy of our beliefs. For example:
- Why might my belief not be true?
- What other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief?
- Are there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true?
- What sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief?
- What are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what’s their support, and why might they be right instead of me?
- What other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did?”

“It is a lot easier to have someone else offer their perspective than for you to imagine you’re another person and think about what their perspective might be.”

“methods used to measure the degree of confidence”

**“For example, if a corporate strategy group is figuring out how to integrate operations following a merger, someone who initially opposed the merger would be good to have as part of the group. Perhaps they have reasons why the two sales departments won’t mesh—whatever their reasons, they could help the majority move forward with a wiser approach by taking those reasons into account.”**

“First, the Heterodox Academy effort shows that there is a natural drift toward homogeneity and confirmatory thought.”

“Second, groups with diverse viewpoints are the best protection against confirmatory thought.”

**“Even among those who are committed to truthseeking, judges and academics, we can see how strong the tendency is to seek out confirmation of our beliefs. If you have any doubt this is true for all of us, put this book down for a moment and check your Twitter feed for whom you follow. It’s a pretty safe bet that the bulk of them are ideologically aligned with you. If that’s the case, start following some people from the other side of the aisle.”**

### Chapter 5: Dissent to win

CUDOS: Communism (information belongs to group), Universalism (apply uniform standards), Disinterestedness (it's not about promoting self or group), Organized Skepticism (open and inviting to questions)

“After all, as Jonathan Haidt points out, we are all our own best PR agents, spinning a narrative that shines the most flattering light on us.”

### Chapter 6: Adventures in mental time travel

“Just as we can recruit other people to be our decision buddies”

“Improving decision quality is about increasing our chances of good outcomes, not guaranteeing them.”

“This tendency we all have to favor our present-self at the expense of our future-self is called temporal discounting.”

“ We are willing to take an irrationally large discount to get a reward now instead of waiting for a bigger reward later.”

“Retirement planning involves a series of decisions in which our present-self can act to the detriment or benefit of our future-self. ”

“Night Jerry gets a glimpse of what Morning Jerry looks like without enough sleep to function.”

“we are more likely to make choices consistent with our long-term goals when we can get out of the moment and engage our past- and future-selves”

“We can then create a habit routine around these decision interrupts to encourage this perspective taking, asking ourselves a set of simple questions at the moment of the decision designed to get future-us and past-us involved.”

“Every 10-10-10 process starts with a question. . . . [W]hat are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years?” This set of questions triggers mental time travel that cues that accountability conversation (also encouraged by a truthseeking decision group). We can build on Welch’s tool by asking the questions through the frame of the past: “How would I feel today if I had made this decision ten minutes ago? Ten months ago? Ten years ago?”

“By planning ahead, we can devise a plan to respond to a negative outcome instead of just reacting to it. We can also familiarize ourselves with the likelihood of a negative outcome and how it will feel. Coming to peace with a bad outcome in advance will feel better than refusing to acknowledge it, facing it only after it has happened.”

“Our problem is that we’re ticker watchers of our own lives. Happiness (however we individually define it) is not best measured by looking at the ticker, zooming in and magnifying moment-by-moment or day-by-day movements. We would be better off thinking about our happiness as a long-term stock holding. We would do well to view our happiness through a wide-angle lens, striving for a long, sustaining upward trend in our happiness stock, so it resembles the first Berkshire Hathaway chart.”

“Surfers have more than twenty terms to describe different kinds of waves. ”

“But for people involved in specialized activities, it’s worth it to be able to communicate a complex concept in a single word that laypeople would need lengthy phrases to convey. Having a nuanced, precise vocabulary is what jargon is all about.”

“bad outcomes can have an impact on your emotions that compromise your decision-making going forward so that you make emotionally charged, irrational decisions that are likely to result in more bad outcomes that will then negatively impact your decision-making going forward and so on.” The most common is tilt.”

“We can take some space till we calm down and get some perspective, recognizing that when we are on tilt we aren’t decision fit”

“Ulysses contracts: time traveling to precommit"

“Most illustrations of Ulysses contracts, like the original, involve raising a barrier against irrationality. ”

“ A barrier-inducing Ulysses contract could involve us not going to the mall at all or budgeting our time tightly so we have just enough time to accomplish our intended purpose. A barrier-reducing contract would be to precommit to carry healthy snacks in our bag, so we can increase the probability, if we’re doing any idle eating, that we can make a better choice since we have drastically reduced the effort it takes to grab a healthier snack.”

“Regardless of the level of binding, precommitment contracts trigger a decision-interrupt. At the moment when we consider breaking the contract, when we want to cut the binding, we are much more likely to stop and think.”

“A lawyer attending a settlement negotiation can make a precommitment, with the client or other lawyers on their team, as to the lowest amount they would accept in a settlement (or the highest amount they would agree to pay to settle). Home buyers, understanding that in the moment they might get emotionally attached to a home, can commit in advance to their budget.”

“A “decision swear jar” is a simple kind of precommitment contract that we can apply to many of the key concepts of this book. For the decision swear jar, we identify the language and thinking patterns that signal we are veering from our goal of truthseeking. When we find ourselves using certain words or succumbing to the thinking patterns we are trying to avoid because we know they are signs of irrationality, a stop-and-think moment can be can be created. You can think about this as a way to implement accountability.”

“but here is a sample of the kinds of things that might trigger a decision-interrupt:”

“
- Signs of the illusion of certainty: “I know,” “I’m sure,” “I knew it,” “It always happens this way,” “I’m certain of it,” “you’re 100% wrong,” “You have no idea what you’re talking about,” “There’s no way that’s true,” “0%” or “100%” or their equivalents, and other terms signaling that we’re presuming things are more certain than we know they are. This also includes stating things as absolutes, like “best” or “worst” and “always” or “never.”
- Overconfidence: similar terms to the illusion of certainty.
- Irrational outcome fielding: “I can’t believe how unlucky I got,” or the reverse, if we have some default phrase for credit taking, like “I’m at the absolute top of my game” or “I planned it perfectly.” This includes conclusions of luck, skill, blame, or credit. It includes equivalent terms for irrationally fielding the outcomes of others, like, “They totally had that coming,” “They brought it on themselves,” and “Why do they always get so lucky?”
- Any kind of moaning or complaining about bad luck just to off-load it, with no real point to the story other than to get sympathy. (An exception would be when we’re in a truthseeking group and we make explicit that we’re taking a momentary break to vent.)
- Generalized characterizations of people meant to dismiss their ideas: insulting, pejorative characterizations of others, like “idiot” or, in poker, “donkey.” Or any phrase that starts by characterizing someone as “another typical ________.” (Like David Letterman said to Lauren Conrad, he dismissed everyone around him as an idiot, until he pulled himself into deliberative mind one day and asked, “What are the odds that everyone is an idiot?”)
- Other violations of the Mertonian norm of universalism, shooting the message because we don’t think much of the messenger. Any sweeping term about someone, particularly when we equate our assessment of an idea with a sweeping personality or intellectual assessment of the person delivering the idea, such as “gun nut,” “bleeding heart,” “East Coast,” “Bible belter,” “California values”—political or social issues. Also be on guard for the reverse: accepting a message because of the messenger or praising a source immediately after finding out it confirms your thinking.
- Signals that we have zoomed in on a moment, out of proportion with the scope of time: “worst day ever,” “the day from hell.”
- Expressions that explicitly signal motivated reasoning, accepting or rejecting information without much evidence like “conventional wisdom” or “if you ask anybody” or “Can you prove that it’s not true?” Similarly, look for expressions that you’re participating in an echo chamber, like “everyone agrees with me.”
- The word “wrong,” which deserves its own swear jar. The Mertonian norm of organized skepticism allows little place in exploratory discussion for the word “wrong.” “Wrong” is a conclusion, not a rationale. And it’s not a particularly accurate conclusion since, as we know, nearly nothing is 100% or 0%. Any words or thoughts denying the existence of uncertainty should be a signal that we are heading toward a poorly calibrated decision.
- Lack of self-compassion: if we’re going to be self-critical, the focus should be on the lesson and how to calibrate future decisions. “I have the worst judgment on relationships” or “I should have known” or “How could I be so stupid?”
- Signals we’re being overly generous editors when we share a story. Especially in our truthseeking group, are we straying from sharing the facts to emphasize our version? Even outside our group, unless we’re sharing a story purely for entertainment value, are we assuring that our listener will agree with us? In general, are we violating the Mertonian norm of communism?
- Infecting our listeners with a conflict of interest, including our own conclusion or belief when asking for advice or informing the listener of the outcome before getting their input.
- Terms that discourage engagement of others and their opinions, including expressions of certainty and also initial phrasing inconsistent with that great lesson from improvisation—“yes, and . . .” That includes getting opinions or information from others and starting with “no” or “but . . .”

“Better precommitment contracts result from better anticipation of what the future might look like, what kinds of decisions we want to avoid, and which ones we want to promote. ”

Betting on a future, belief -> bet -> set of outcomes. Scenario planning is mapping out the possibilities and probabilities. 

“This kind of scenario planning is a form of mental time travel we can do on our own. It works even better when we do it as part of a scenario-planning group, particularly one that is open-minded to dissent and diverse points of view. Diverse viewpoints allow for the identification of a wider variety of scenarios deeper into the tree, and for better estimates of their probability.”

“Backcasting: working backward from a positive future”
“imagine we’ve already achieved a positive outcome, holding up a newspaper with the headline “We Achieved Our Goal!” Then we think about how we got there.”

“Premortems: working backward from a negative future”
“A premortem is an investigation into something awful, but before it happens”
“Backcasting is the cheerleader; a premortem is the heckler in the audience.”

“Imagining a headline that reads “We Failed to Reach Our Goal” challenges us to think about ways in which things could go wrong”

“Despite the popular wisdom that we achieve success through positive visualization, it turns out that incorporating negative visualization makes us more likely to achieve our goals.”

“All those reasons why we didn’t achieve our goal help us anticipate potential obstacles and improve our likelihood of succeeding.”

“A premortem is an implementation of the Mertonian norm of organized skepticism”
